# AI-Based HVAC Optimization System

This project optimizes HVAC placement in a 3D building model using AI and FreeCAD.  
Users can upload a CAD file, AI predicts the best HVAC placement, and the updated model is automatically generated.

## Features

-   Extracts CAD features such as room dimensions and HVAC placements using FreeCAD.
-   Trains a neural network to predict optimal HVAC placement.
-   Applies AI-predicted HVAC placement to a FreeCAD model.
-   Provides an interactive 3D visualization of before and after HVAC placements.
-   Streamlit-based web app for easy user interaction.

## Prerequisites

### Install Python 3.11.x

Download and install Python 3.11.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Upgrade Pip

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow torch torchvision torchaudio open3d streamlit flask boto3
```

### Install FreeCAD

-   Download and install FreeCAD from the [official website](https://www.freecad.org/).
-   Ensure FreeCAD is added to Python’s system path.

## Running the Project

### 1. Extract CAD Features

```sh
python extract_cad_features.py
```

This extracts room dimensions and HVAC placements from a FreeCAD file and saves the extracted data to `cad_features.json`.

### 2. Train the AI Model

```sh
python train_hvac_ai.py
```

This trains a deep learning model to predict optimal HVAC placement and saves the trained model as `hvac_model.pth`.

### 3. Apply AI to Optimize HVAC Placement

```sh
python apply_hvac_ai.py
```

This loads the trained AI model, updates the HVAC placement in the FreeCAD model, and saves the optimized FreeCAD model as `HVAC_Building_Optimized.FCStd`.

### 4. Run the Streamlit Web App

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

-   Upload a FreeCAD `.FCStd` file.
-   View before and after HVAC placement in an interactive 3D visualization.
-   Download the optimized `.FCStd` file.

## Notes

-   Ensure FreeCAD is installed and added to Python’s path.
-   If the AI model fails to load, delete `hvac_model.pth` and retrain using `train_hvac_ai.py`.
-   The model hyperparameters can be adjusted in `train_hvac_ai.py` for better results.

## Future Improvements

-   Enhance AI model with better feature engineering.
-   Optimize FreeCAD integration for real-time CAD modifications.
-   Add cloud-based processing (AWS/GCP) for large-scale HVAC optimizations.
